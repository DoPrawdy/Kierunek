"Kierunek" means "Direction", it may be a seed for a song.

It started with a simple melody that came out during first weeks of practice on a bansuri flute (flute loop). If there was any inspiration other than limited bansuri abilities (yes, I find limitation inspiring), it would be the surroundings of a surfing and yoga trip in Sri Lanka.

The melody made me imagine the rhythm and progresion of the guitar part (guitar loop), developed for some time and recorded later, along with a simple bass line (bass loop).

The lower flute part (flute2 loop) was also recorded later, after buying and practicing on a bigger, more professional bansuri flute.

The additional guitar part (guitar 2 loop) is an effect of observing simple harmonies related to the progression.
